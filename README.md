# Network-Intrusion-Detection
Analysis for Model Selection for Network Intrusion Detection

# About:

In this mini-project for our SC1015 Module, we look at a Network Intrusion Detection Dataset consisting of a wide variety of intrusions simulated in a military network environment. 

# Background:

In today's day and age, our day to day lives are made easier with digital aid. However, this makes us more vulnerable to cyber security threats. Hence, it is very important that we keep our network security systems up to date and viable.

# Objective:

Our objective is to use the network detection dataset together with various machine learning models for anomaly detection to find out which one is the best to build a network intrusion detection model.

# Models Compared:

- KNN
- Random forest classifier
- Logistics Regression
